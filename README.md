The 'Data dump' part was not clear to me, what need to be dumped/showed there, so I decided to dump the whole raw JSON there, it's easy to copy it or see the 'true' data.

## How to deploy/use it:
* clone the repo ```git@github.com:szepnapot/homework.git```
* run ```npm install```
* run ```python -m SimpleHTTPServer```
* open 'localhost:8000' via browser
